CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmagic_enum.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "magic_enum", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "magic_enum" with
  any of the following names:

    magic_enumConfig.cmake
    magic_enum-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "magic_enum" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "magic_enum_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "magic_enum" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
